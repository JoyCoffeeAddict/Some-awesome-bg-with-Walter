# Stellae - Animated Wallpaper

Stellae is a kind of wallpaper engine but for linux. It uses chromium to display animated wallpapers compacted into single HTML files that embed CSS and JS as a wallpaper

**It's a personal experimental project to recreate a semblance of a wallpaper engine on Linux, don't expect miracles**

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

The program requires some dependencies to work properly :

- xdotool [xdotool(1) — xdotool — Debian testing — Debian Manpages](https://manpages.debian.org/testing/xdotool/xdotool.1.en.html)
- devilspie [devilspie(1) — devilspie — Debian testing — Debian Manpages](https://manpages.debian.org/testing/devilspie/devilspie.1.en.html)

**_xdotool_** : lets you programmatically (or manually) simulate keyboard input and mouse activity, move and resize windows, etc. It does this using X11's XTEST extension and other Xlib functions.
**_devilspie_** : is a program which can detect windows as they are created, and perform actions on them if they match as set of criteria.

Each of these programs allows the Stellae script to interact with chromium

So please install the following packages

```bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install xdotool devilspie
```

Get the latest packaged version of Stellae, decompress where you want

```bash
unzip <STELLAE.ZIP>
```
